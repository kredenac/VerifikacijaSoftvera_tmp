The stewardess came to check on me again. This time she sat next to
me and asked if I was all right.
"I'm fine, thanks," I said with a smile. "Just feeling kind of blue."
"I know what you mean," she said. "It happens to me, too, every once
in a while."
She stood and gave me a lovely smile. "Well, then, have a nice trip.
Auf Wiedersehen."
"Auf Wiedersehen."
